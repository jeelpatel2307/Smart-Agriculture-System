# Smart Agriculture System

This project implements a basic Smart Agriculture System in Java. It simulates monitoring environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture for different crops on a farm.

## Overview

The Smart Agriculture System consists of the following components:

- **Farm**: Represents a farm that contains multiple crops.
- **Crop**: Represents an individual crop with attributes such as crop name, temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.

## Usage

To use the Smart Agriculture System:

1. Run the `SmartAgricultureSystem` class.
2. The program will create a farm named "Smart Farm" and add two crops, wheat, and rice.
3. Environmental data (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) will be simulated for each crop, and the environment will be updated accordingly.

## Classes

1. **Farm**: Represents a farm that contains multiple crops. It has methods to add crops and get the list of crops.
2. **Crop**: Represents an individual crop with attributes such as crop name, temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. It has a method to update the environment.

## Example Output

```
Environment updated for Wheat: Temp=25.124, Humidity=68.734, Soil Moisture=43.213
Environment updated for Rice: Temp=27.315, Humidity=72.891, Soil Moisture=50.107

```
